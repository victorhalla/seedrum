# SEEDRUM
SEEDRUM is a home hydroponic setup based on a Oil Drum. 

Currently, there are several hydroponic systems available for residential use, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Usually for residential use it is important that the system is small and that it can fulfill its function.

The idea of using oil barrels for this purpose arose because they are widely available at extremely low costs, help with recycling and are used today as decorative elements.

Main idea is to use an hydroponic controller like [SEEDUP](https://victorhalla.github.io/seedup.controller/) that will take care of everything needed by the plants creating a perfect enviroment for grow.

This repository will provide instructions for mounting a SEEDRUM as well as the different mounting options available for each type of plant.
